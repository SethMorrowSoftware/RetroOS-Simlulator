# CLAUDE.md — IlluminatOS! (newRetroOS)

## Project Overview

IlluminatOS! is a Windows 95-themed desktop OS emulator running in the browser. It features a full windowing system, 42 apps, a virtual filesystem, multiplayer support via WebSocket, a custom scripting language (RetroScript), plugin system, campaign/narrative engine, and a PHP REST API backend with admin panel.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules), HTML5, CSS3 — no build step, no framework
- **Backend**: PHP (no framework), PDO/MySQL, token-based auth
- **Realtime**: Pure PHP WebSocket server (RFC 6455), Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Scripting**: RetroScript — custom `.retro` scripting language
- **Server**: Apache (`.htaccess`) or PHP built-in server

## Development Setup

### Frontend only (no backend)
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

### With PHP backend v2 (full features)
```bash
cp backend/env.example.php backend/env.php
# Edit backend/env.php with MySQL credentials
php backend/migrate.php
php backend/seed.php          # optional: seed default admin
php -S localhost:8000
```

### WebSocket server
```bash
php websocket/server.php      # typically port 8081
```

## Testing

### Backend API tests
```bash
php test-backend.php [base-url]       # Smoke tests for all API endpoints
php test-security.php [base-url]      # Security/authorization tests
```

### Linting
```bash
bash scripts/lint-innerhtml.sh        # Detect unsafe innerHTML usage
```

### Aggregated CI gate
```bash
bash scripts/ci-gate.sh                # Runs all 5 gates: JS syntax, PHP lint,
                                       # innerHTML safety, RetroScript harness,
                                       # event-schema coverage
```

### Manual validation checklist
1. Start server and open in browser
2. Check boot console logs for errors
3. Test app launch from Start menu and terminal
4. Verify no uncaught errors in browser console
5. Test persistence by reload
6. Check `window.__OS_BOOT_HEALTH` in console for per-component diagnostics
7. Check `window.__OS_HEALTH` for the live HealthMonitor snapshot (subscription
   accounting, storage telemetry, event-bus stats, feature posture, realtime
   state, recent faults). `degraded` reasons (`boot` / `validationErrors` /
   `failedFeatures` / `faults` / `subscriptionLeak`) make triage deterministic.

## Architecture Patterns

### Frontend

- **Event-driven**: Central `EventBus` (pub/sub) with `SemanticEventBus` for schema-validated events. `SemanticEventBus` also owns the unified command registry — call `EventBus.registerCommand(name, handler)` and `EventBus.executeCommand(name, payload)`. `CommandBus.js` is a thin facade kept for backwards compatibility; both APIs share the same registry (`CommandBus.handlers` is a *reference* to `SemanticEventBus.commandHandlers`). Every script-engine call site routes through `EventBus.executeCommand`. Full file deletion is tracked as F1 in `docs/MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md`.
- **State management**: `StateManager` with reactive subscriptions and `resetVolatile()` for clean user-switch. For persisted paths (`icons`, `settings.sound`, etc.) use `setStateAndPersist(path, value)` to avoid state↔storage drift — it writes storage first and only commits the in-memory change if the write succeeds.
- **Storage hardening**: `StorageManager.set/get/setGlobal/getGlobal` reject any payload containing `__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype` keys at any depth (rejections tallied in `telemetry.unsafeKeyRejections`). During a remote snapshot hydration, UI-driven `.set()` calls are dropped (tallied in `telemetry.hydrationDrops`); the hydrator uses `beginHydration()` / `hydrationSet(key, value)` / `endHydration()` to write the incoming payload without tripping the guard.
- **Singletons**: Core systems exported as `export default new ClassName()`
- **Subscription ownership**: `SubscriptionManager` (`core/SubscriptionManager.js`) tracks every `EventBus.on()` and `StateManager.subscribe()` return against the active owner. Set the owner via `SubscriptionManager.runAs(ownerId, fn)` — `AppBase` does this around `onOpen`/`onMount` (owner = windowId), `FeatureBase` around `initialize()` (owner = featureId), `PluginLoader` around `onLoad()` (owner = pluginId). On close/disable/unload/logout, `SubscriptionManager.unsubscribeAll(ownerId)` releases everything. The existing `this.subscribe()` / `this.onEvent()` helpers in AppBase/FeatureBase still work — SubscriptionManager is an additional safety net for raw `.on()` calls inside lifecycle code.
- **AppBase**: All apps extend `AppBase` with lifecycle methods (`onOpen`, `onClose`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `onMount`). Multi-instance apps **must** use `setInstanceState()` / `getInstanceState()` — every app in the tree has been audited and either uses per-instance state or is `singleton: true` deliberately. `AppBase.setContent()` releases any `addHandler()`-registered listener whose target sits inside the replaced subtree before swapping HTML, so re-rendered content can't leak handlers pointing at detached nodes.
- **FeatureBase**: Background features extend `FeatureBase` with `initialize()`, `enable()`, `disable()`, `cleanup()`. `disable()` does **not** reset `initialized` — re-enable will not re-run `initialize()`; subclasses that genuinely need re-init must override `disable()` to clear it explicitly. Concurrent enable/disable calls are serialized by an internal lifecycle queue, so two clicks can't double-run `initialize()`.
- **CommandBus**: ⚠️ Deprecated. Existing imports keep working — the file is a thin facade whose `handlers` Map is a reference to `SemanticEventBus.commandHandlers`, and whose `register/execute` delegate to the unified API. New code should call `EventBus.registerCommand()` / `EventBus.executeCommand()` directly. The script engine no longer takes `CommandBus` in its context (`ScriptEngine.initialize({ EventBus, FileSystemManager, ... })` — no `CommandBus` field) — every interpreter visitor and media/system builtin goes through `EventBus.executeCommand`. The file itself still exists at boot because it registers `command:fs:*` / `command:window:*` / `command:terminal:*` handlers and owns timer/macro state; full deletion is tracked as F1 in `docs/MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md`.
- **SessionManager**: Single owner of the logout / user-switch cascade. Always call `SessionManager.logout()` or `SessionManager.switchUser(newUser)` instead of tearing down realtime/presence/state by hand. Cascade order is: `MultiplayerClient.disconnect` → `closeRealtime` → `PresenceManager.destroy` → `setSessionToken(null)` → `SubscriptionManager.unsubscribeAll('session')` → `StateManager.resetVolatile`, then `user:logout` / `user:switch` emitted for subscribers.
- **Authenticated HTTP**: `fetchWithAuth(input, init)` from `ConfigLoader.js` is the single way to call the v2 API. Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` automatically, and on 401 routes through `SessionManager.logout({ reason: 'auth_expired' })` so the frontend stops looping with a stale token. Pass `skipAuth: true` in the init object for endpoints that intentionally don't carry the session (login, register).
- **Cross-process event topology**: `core/EventTopology.js` is the single registry of every backend event bridged to the frontend (`{ backend, frontend?, transports, description? }`). `RealtimeClient` derives its allowlist from this list — adding a new SSE event means adding one topology entry, not editing three files. When a topology entry sets `frontend`, RealtimeClient emits both `sse:<backend>` (legacy alias for existing handlers in `index.js`) and the semantic frontend name (subscribe to this in new code).
- **Virtual filesystem**: `FileSystemManager` with permissions, locking, events.
- **Script path validation**: `core/script/utils/PathValidation.validateScriptPath()` is the single allowlist for script-driven file ops; reuse it instead of inlining new prefix lists.

### Backend

- **Single entry point**: All v2 API requests route through `api/v2/index.php`
- **MVC-ish**: Controllers → Models → Database (PDO singleton)
- **Static model methods**: Models use static methods for data access, no ORM
- **Middleware chain**: Auth, rate limiting, JSON parsing, CORS
- **Three-tier config**: `defaults.json` → system_config DB → user_config DB (deep merged)
- **Event-driven**: `EventService::dispatch()` → DB log → webhooks → SSE
- **WebSocket auth**: Tokens travel via `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: token.<hex>` (the only request header browsers let JS set on a WS upgrade). The server (`websocket/server.php`) still accepts `Authorization: Bearer` and legacy `?token=` query params for compatibility, but new clients must use the subprotocol form so tokens stay out of URLs / proxy logs / browser history.

### Data flow
```
User Interaction → UI Handler → EventBus.emit() → StateManager update
→ StorageManager persist → Subscriber callbacks → UI re-render
```

### User session lifecycle

The session lifecycle is unified through `SessionManager` plus four canonical events:

| Event | When it fires | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `user:login` | After token set, storage rescoped, `StateManager.initialize()` complete | Subscribers can safely hit the network as the new user |
| `user:logout` | After realtime/presence/token/state teardown | Late subscribers can drop session caches |
| `user:switch` | After teardown but before new scope is hydrated | Subscribers can clear caches before rehydrate |
| `auth:expired` | `fetchWithAuth` saw a 401; teardown ran; token cleared | `features/ReauthGate.js` surfaces a reauth prompt (with a single-flight guard) and re-runs `LoginScreen.show()` |

Never tear down `MultiplayerClient`, `RealtimeClient`, or `PresenceManager` directly from a UI handler — go through `SessionManager`.

## Coding Conventions

### Naming
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`Calculator`, `EventBus`)
- **Functions/methods**: camelCase (`getState`, `createWindow`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`WINDOW`, `DESKTOP`)
- **CSS classes**: kebab-case (`.window-manager`, `.start-menu`)
- **Files**: Match class name or describe role
- **DB columns**: snake_case
- **JSON API responses**: camelCase

### JavaScript
- ES Module imports at top, grouped by: core → UI → apps → features
- No build step — raw ES modules served directly
- HTML generation must use `escapeHtml()` / `escAttr()` for user data (XSS prevention)
- Files using `.innerHTML =` must import sanitize utilities (enforced by lint script)

### CSS
- One file per app in `styles/apps/`
- Shared components in `styles/components/`
- Theme variables in `styles/core/variables.css`
- Import order matters: core → effects → features → layout → components → apps

### PHP
- Prepared statements for all SQL (no raw interpolation)
- `jsonResponse()` / `jsonError()` helpers for API responses
- `input($key, $default)` for request body access
- Password hashing: `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` with cost=12
- Rate limiting: file-based sliding window with `flock()`

## Security Guidelines

- **Never** interpolate user input into SQL — use prepared statements
- **Never** set `.innerHTML` with unescaped user data — use `escapeHtml()`
- **Never** commit `backend/env.php`, `config/admin-credentials.php`, or `config/overrides.json`
- **Never** put session tokens in URLs (query strings, fragments). For WebSocket auth, pass the token via `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: token.<hex>`.
- **Always** route script-initiated and command-bus-initiated file ops through `validateScriptPath()` (or `ScriptEngine.validateScriptPath()`). The script engine, the SSE remote-FS handler in `index.js`, and the `command:fs:*` handlers in `CommandBus.js` all share this single allowlist.
- **Never** store user-controlled JSON in `localStorage` (or hand it to `StorageManager`) without going through `StorageManager.set` — its prototype-pollution guard rejects payloads with `__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype` keys.
- Config section validation strips HTML, blocks `url()`, `javascript:`, `expression()` in CSS
- WebSocket messages are rate-limited (30/sec) and size-limited (64 KB)
- API rate limiting is per-user/IP with configurable windows
- Max request body: 512 KB

## Adding New Components

### New App
1. Create `apps/MyApp.js` extending `AppBase`
2. Implement `onOpen()` (return HTML), `onClose()` (cleanup)
3. Register in `apps/AppRegistry.js`
4. Add CSS in `styles/apps/my-app.css` and import in styles
5. Add to Start menu config if needed

### New Feature
1. Create `features/MyFeature.js` extending `FeatureBase`
2. Implement `initialize()`. Don't reimplement enable/disable unless you have a specific reason — the base class handles state, lifecycle locking, and cleanup wiring.
3. Override `cleanup()` (called from `disable()`) to release listeners/timers/DOM. Anything you register through `this.subscribe(...)` / `this.addHandler(...)` is auto-cleaned.
4. Register in `features/` index (or via plugin manifest).
5. Provide metadata: id, name, description, icon, category, optional `dependencies`, optional `settings` schema for the UI.

> ⚠️ Do **not** assume `initialize()` will re-run if your feature is toggled off and back on. It only runs once per process. If you need re-init semantics, override `disable()` to set `this.initialized = false` before calling `super.disable()`.

### New Plugin
1. Create `plugins/features/my-plugin/index.js` with manifest
2. Export `{ id, name, version, features: [], apps: [], onLoad, onUnload }`
3. Add feature/app classes in the plugin directory

> ⚠️ The plugin manifest is validated before registration (`PluginLoader._validatePluginManifest`). `id` must match `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/` and be ≤64 chars. Duplicate feature/app IDs within the manifest, declared `feature.dependencies` that don't resolve, and non-function `onLoad`/`onUnload` are all rejected up front. The loader is transactional: `loaded: true` is set only after `onLoad()` plus every feature/app registration succeed — a failed load rolls back precisely what it registered and runs `onUnload()` for symmetry.

### New API Endpoint
1. Add controller method in `backend/controllers/`
2. Register route in `api/v2/index.php`
3. Apply appropriate middleware (auth, rate limiting)
4. Use `EventService::dispatch()` for auditable actions

## Event System

Events use namespaced format: `window:open`, `app:close`, `ui:menu:start:toggle`, etc. Schemas live in `core/schema/` with validation. `SemanticEventBus` provides middleware, logging, request/response, channels, and the unified command registry. There is no separate `EventBus` implementation — `core/EventBus.js` is a one-line re-export so old imports keep working (the re-export is kept indefinitely — see `docs/MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` for the rationale).

The canonical user-session events are `user:login`, `user:logout`, `user:switch`, `auth:expired` (see `core/schema/system.js`).

> Old aliases like `pet:toggle`, `taskbar:update`, `boot:complete` are no longer auto-rewritten. Use the semantic names directly: `feature:pet:toggle`, `ui:taskbar:update`, `system:ready`. The legacy mapping table is gone — grep is reliable.

Event-schema coverage is enforced in CI: `node scripts/check-event-schema-coverage.mjs` fails if non-app-scoped emitted events drop below 95% schema coverage. The current run is 100%.

## RetroScript

Custom scripting language (`.retro` files) for automation. See `SCRIPTING_GUIDE.md` for the dense top-level reference, and `docs/retroscript/` for a learning-oriented guide, an alphabetical dictionary, and ten progressive tutorials ending in a full mini-ARG campaign. Engine lives in `core/script/` with lexer, parser, and interpreter.

Script file ops (`write` / `read` / `delete` / `mkdir`) validate paths against the shared allowlist in `core/script/utils/PathValidation.js`. The allowlist also covers the SSE-driven remote FS ops in `index.js`. Don't inline new prefix arrays — add to `PathValidation` and have both call-sites use it.
